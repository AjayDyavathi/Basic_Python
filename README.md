# Basic_Python
basic scripts for understanding concepts of python

ALl these scripts are a part of my practice in learning python and other modules,
kindly ignore the appplied names, and any personal details as examples in the implementation of programs.
They're all just part of learning!

While some of the basics are so basic, some are not so. Feel free to check all.
